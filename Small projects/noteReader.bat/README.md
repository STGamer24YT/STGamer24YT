# noteReader.bat
*(insert epic logo here)*

A batch file that reads `.txt` files (I know I always create innovating programs)

## How to use

Just execute the file (`noteReader.bat`), this will create the `LICENSE.txt` file and the `notes\` directory inside of the folder in which the batch file exists.

After that you type the name of your file (can't contain quotation marks or spaces) without the extension (ALL FILES NEED TO BE `.txt` FILES). You can put unlimited files inside the `notes\` directory. *(cmd can't display every unicode character properly, so some files may look strange when accessed from the program)*
