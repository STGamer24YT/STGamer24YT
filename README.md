# About me

- I watch a lot of youTube
- I use Lua to use Roblox games
  - I don't understand Lua without all the libraries that Roblox includes
- I'm studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I usually check issues in [geode-sdk/geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode)
- I know how to use Batch, and I make the code unnecessarily ugly :trollface:

### Random code in Batch

``` Batch
@echo off
title Welcome
echo Hi, this is a virus
timeout /t 5 /nobreak >nul
title goodbye PC
cls
echo System32, and SysWOW64 are being deleted, please wait
timeout /t 1 /nobreak >nul
cls
